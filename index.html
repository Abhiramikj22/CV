  <h3>ACADEMIC PROJECT</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Major Project : Smart Baby Cradle

      <P>Baby Cradle is an efficient and low cost IoT-based system for baby monitoring in real time.
        The cradle swings automatically on detection of baby cry sound using a sound sensor.
       A fan is switched ON when the room temperature exceeds a certain threshold. Parents can also
        monitor their babies’ condition through an external web camera. In the Blynk, the data measured
        by the sensors like temperature sensor, moisture sensor and sound sensor can be monitored.</p></li>
    <li>

     Minor Project : Smart Dustbin
    <p>

   Smart dustbin is just a normal bin where everyone can dispose waste but integration of some
      hardware components is done for more efficient use of it. Smart Dustbin is integrated
      with some hardware components such as Arduino, Servo Motor, Ultrasonic sensor.These
      components help in opening the lid, on detection of human hand and waste. The code required to
      perform the above mentioned operation is dumped in Arduino.  </p>
